  //LETS have a look at constants
    //constants are values that don't change (fixed)
        // we have 
            //integer constants: 1,2,3,0,-1,-2

            //real constants: 1.0, 2.0, 3.14, -2.4
            
            //character constants (need to be enclosed in single quotes): 'a', 'b', 'A', '#', '&'
